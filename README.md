Program Description

- This program reads provided keywords and respnses and stores it in a binary tree for quick access. It can gradually learn to respond more accurately based on user feedback

Important things to consider

â€” The file is assumed to contain the keyword then its response directly on the next line
- This submission contains a dictionary file "testFile.txt" that you may use and alter if you wish
- NOTE: do not add any spaces before or after a word when adding a new keyword to the tree, the program will recognize it and store it with the space in the word. 
- Learning rate is a constant of 0.5 for this assignment

Additional Features

- The program is defensive towards invalid input for all prompts
